# Namedays

This package provides Swift classes of name days, a common concept in some 
European countries where names are assigned to individual days of the year.

The package is intended to be used by Swift applications maintained
separately. By putting this package in a public repository it is possible,
as well as encouraged, to suggest additions or changes to this file to add
support for other countries or to make suggestions.
